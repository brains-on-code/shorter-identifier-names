</p>
<p>My name is Johannes Hofmeister and I am a student of Psychology at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. I also designed this experiment and the software.</p>
<p>I work as a software developer and have often asked myself the question why there is bad code.</p>

  Proudly made with Python, Flask, Heroku, Angular.js, Bootstrap. Not so proud about javascript though.
